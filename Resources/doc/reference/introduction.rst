Introduction
============

News Bundle is A blog platform based on Doctrine2 and Symfony2.

Permalink
---------

The bundle comes with 2 services to generate a permalink :

  * sonata.news.permalink.date : generates an url depending on the publication start date (/2011/12/31/new-year)
  * sonata.news.permalink.category : generates and url depending on the related category (/party/new-year)

Text Formatting
---------------

The content of a blog post can be formatted in different format : 
  * markdown, 
  * raw html,
  * or using nl2br. 

This feature is handled by the ``SonataFormatterBundle``.

Comments
--------

Comments can be enabled or disabled depending on the policy selected while creating a Post. 
An email is sent everytime a comment is added to a Post. The email contains the comment informations such as: 
  * mail, 
  * message, 
  * url,
  * etc ...) 
and a 2 quick moderation link : ``activate`` or ``disable`` the comment.
